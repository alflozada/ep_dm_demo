## What is ep_dm_demo?
An Etherpad Plugin to apply the ep_dm_demo functionality in a pad. (describe in minimum 50 Letters what it is)
Currently supports:
* ep_dm_demo functionality 1
* ep_dm_demo functionality 2
* ep_dm_demo functionality 3
* ep_dm_demo functionality 4

## ep_dm_demo Usage
Experimental.  As a special attribute on Etherpad, some weirdness may be experienced by using ep_dm_demo.

## ep_dm_demo History
I decided to copy/paste the ep_t3 over ep_dm_demo to create that plugin.
